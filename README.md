## Errata

Official Packt errata page is https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/support/33683

### Chapter 2
 * Page 42. `ULARGE_INTEGER` is a union, not a structure.
 * Page 49. You should include "#include <stdio.h>" if you have some compilation errors with `std:sscanf()` in the "SysInfoLinuxImpl.cpp" file.
 * Page 64. The sentence should be: "mPointPositionX is a long long int variable (qint64)".
 
 ### Chapter 3
 * Page 83. The unix platform scope could be generated for a 'library' Qt project, even if you create the project from a Windows desktop.
 * Page 87. The `GALLERYCORESHARED_EXPORT` macro must be added right *AFTER* the 'class' keyword (not before).
 * Page 93. It's `QSqlQuery::bindValue()`, not `QSqlQuery::bind()`.
 * Page 112. The `endRemoveRows()` function, which simply triggers the `rowsRemoved()` signal.
 
  ### Chapter 4
  * Fix Album model index (trigger ASSERT on Windows DEBUG platform). Check [PR #1](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Qt-5-Second-Editon/pull/1) (thanks @ziembla)

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
void MemoryWidget::updateSeries()
{
    double memoryUsed = SysInfo::instance().memoryUsed();
    mSeries->append(mPointPositionX++, memoryUsed);
    if (mSeries->count() > CHART_X_RANGE_COUNT) {
        QChart* chart = chartView().chart();
        chart->scroll(chart->plotArea().width()
            / CHART_X_RANGE_MAX, 0);
        mSeries->remove(0);
    }
}
```

## Get to Know the Authors
**Guillaume Lazar** is a software engineer living in France near Paris. He has worked in different companies, from startups to multinationals, in the last 10 years. He took the opportunity to observe and learn many team organizations and technologies.

In 2014, he founded his own software development company at the age of 27. The current hierarchical organization that applies to most companies seems obsolete to him. With his own company, he wants to try a different approach.

Although he defines himself as a Qt framework lover, he likes to mix different technologies and platforms. He also spends time on game development, machine learning, and electronics, because "things" become "alive".

**Robin Penea** has been working in the software industry for a more than a decade. He worked in startups and large companies with many technologies that ranged from embedded software to web development. Armed with this experience, he wrote the Mastering Qt 5 book to spread what he loves the most about the programming craft : proper design and quality code.The teaching bug has bitten him, and he continues to share what he learned online using videos. When he is not tinkering with some new technology, he either on a wall, rock-climbing or playing music on his piano. You can reach him via Twitter @synapticrob.
